# 🌐 Tech News Portal
## 📋 Project
This repository showcases the development of a technology news portal using HTML and CSS. The main objective was to create a responsive and modern interface, utilizing CSS Grid for layout and adding hover effects and box shadows to enhance interactivity and user experience.

## 🛠️ Features
CSS Grid Layout: The portal's layout is structured using CSS Grid, allowing for efficient and responsive organization of elements across different screen sizes. This modular structure facilitates the arrangement of news articles and sections, creating a clean and organized appearance.

Hover Effects and Shadows: Each news card features hover effects and box-shadow to enhance interactivity and visually highlight elements when users hover over them. These effects provide a more engaging and sophisticated experience.

Navigation Menu: A responsive navigation menu is available at the top, allowing users to access various news categories, such as Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Holograms, and more.

Section Division: The portal is divided into multiple sections, including:

Main News: Highlights with large images and descriptions.
Most Read of the Week: A section with the most popular news articles.
Artificial Intelligence Highlights: A collection focused on AI news.
Did You See This?: A variety of news with an appealing visual approach.
